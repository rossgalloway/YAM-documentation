# Umbrella

[insert umbrella link]()​ is designed to enable Protection Providers to earn premium fees in return for staking funds to be paid out in the event of an exploit to Protection Seekers, who stake and pay a funding rate to earn protection in such an event. There are two pool types in the protocol, one accessed by Protection Providers and one by Protection Seekers. The first pool type are the MetaPools, which are funded by Protection Providers and provide coverage on the second pool type, the Coverage Pools, which are accessed individually by the Protection Seekers. Each MetaPool is made up of Coverage Pools, which provide protection on specific protocols or contracts. An example of a MetaPool could be “Lending Protocols” while the Coverage Pools that Seekers could access would be “Compound”, “Aave”, “Cream.” If any of those protocols experienced an exploit deemed valid by the arbiter of the MetaPool, a portion of the Provider’s stake would be used in a payout to Seekers who had staked for coverage in the affected protocol’s Coverage Pool.
