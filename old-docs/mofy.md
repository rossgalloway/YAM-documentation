## Overview

The Museum of Fine Yams (MoFY) is an NFT art museum and marketplace that focuses on the curation and display of high quality NFT artwork.
There are 3 components to MoFY: [The MoFY dApp](), [MoFY Magazine](), and [Virtual Gallery spaces]() in CryptoVoxels. The goal of MoFY is to provide a unique and seamless experience where art and NFT lovers can mint NFTs inexpensively, browse curated work, and experience NFT art in a new way in CryptoVoxels.

The MoFY dApp and marketplace is built on ZKsync, a new ZK-rollup layer 2 network on Ethereum. ZKsync allows artists and collectors to use the platform without worrying about paying the high gas fees on L1 Ethereum.  
Disclamer: This website is in Beta and some functionality is not yet available. ZKsync is also in beta and may have downtime or occasional issues with response times. If you have problems with the dApp, please come let us know in our discord server: <https://discord.gg/ZF6MvWuH9p>.

## MofY Magazine

MoFY Magazine is a web-2 style publication that focuses on curating, educating, and analyzing the NFT art space, specifically on Ethereum. It is where featured artist bios will be displayed as well as articles dissecting the current state of the NFT market. Through the website, users will be able to access the CryptoVoxels galleries and the marketplace dApp.
The magazine can be found at <https://mofy.yam.xyz>

## MoFY Marketplace

The MoFY Marketplace dApp is your gateway to minting, buying, and selling NFTs on our platform.

### Current Functionality

As of right now, anyone can mint NFTs on zkSync with the dApp, but in order for the NFT to be displayed on the explore page, NFT's need to be whitelisted. We plan on opening this up, or allowing community whitelisting, but this is not yet available.

The dApp can be accessed with metamask or walletconnect. In order to mint or buy NFTs you will need to send funds to your wallet in zkSync. This can either be done through the mint or buy flow in the dApp, or you can do it yourself with <https://wallet.zksync.io>. In order to us ZKsync you need to both deposit funds (there will be L1 Ethereum fees) and active your account for about 0.0016 ETH.

#### Explore

This is the page where featured artists are displayed. click on an image to see the information about that artwork or view the rest of the creator's work. Only whitelisted addresses are currently displayed here.

#### Your Gallery

This is where you can see the NFTs that you have minted or purchased. This page will only show your NFTs on ZKsync and not the ones on Ethereum mainnet.

#### Mint

Create your NFT on the mint page. Enter the name, description, and attributes of your NFT as well as how many you want to mint (currently limited to only 1). PNGs, JPGs, and Gifs are currently supported. Once you mint, it may take a few minutes for the NFT to populate in your gallery.

#### Storage

All NFT images are stored on IPFS. To see the image link in IPFS, right click on an image and click "open in new window." The URL is the IPFS storage location, which you can then pin locally if you desire.
