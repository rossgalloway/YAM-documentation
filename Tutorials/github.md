# Getting Started With Github

### 👋 

This tutorial will walk you through uploading and editing documents on Github so that they will display on the YAM Governance Repository (This website!). Github can seem scary when you first start playing around with it and Git, the underlying software that Github uses, can be frustrating at times. But once you get the hang of it, you can unlock some incredibly useful and powerful features.

This is a beginner tutorial, assuming you basically know nothing about github, and it focuses on using the github website to interact with git and github. At the end of the tutorial I will list some nice tools that make writing documents easier than doing everything on the Github website, but you can do everything without leaving it.

### Quick Github Intro

Github is kind of like a cross between cloud storage and version control for code. And since code files are mostly just text files, with some image files thrown in for good measure, it works great for text documents like grant applications, proposals, etc. It is a great place for us to host important documents with good assurances that they will be available publicly and anyone can contribute by making changes to them and then submitting those changes for inclusion.

Let's get started!

### 1. Sign up

The first step is to sign up for a github account if you don't have one, or if you do navigate to the website and sign in. Go to <https://github.com> to get started.

---

### 2. Go to the repo you want to edit or add to.

Once signed in, you want to navigate to the Github repository you want to edit or add to. A repository is a collection of files that typically make up a project or part of a project. If you are submitting a silo or grant application for the DAO then the repository you want to go to is: <https://github.com/rossgalloway/YAM-Project-Silos> `update when moved to YAM github organization`. This is the repository where all the documents related to the YAM grants process live and are served to the YAM Governance Repository Website.

### 3. Fork the Repo

Once you are signed up and have navigated to the right page (as seen in the red rectangle in the image below on the top-left), the first thing you need to do is fork the repository to make your own copy of the repository. This forked copy of the repository is you own personal copy that you make changes to and then submit those changes to the main repo. The fork will live in your own github account and can even be downloaded directly to your hard-drive. The typical workflow for Github is to work on your fork (copy) and then submit those changes to update the main repository.

### 4. Navigating around your Repo

Once you have forked the repo, you will be able to see your copy on your own profile page. You can always get back to your profile page by clicking the icon in the top right of the Github.com interface, and your new forked repository should live under "your repositories". If you click into the repository you can see that it shows it has been forked and that it is up to date with the main repo.

### 5. Creating a new folder and file

If you are applying for a new grant then you will need to create the new files and folders for your grant application. To do this, click on add file and then name the file with the folder name, a slash, and then the first file (i.e. `treasury-management/silo-application.md`). This will create a new folder called treasury-management and a few file called silo-application.md. You cannot create a folder without a file in it due to how github works, and your file should end with .md, which is the file extension for the markdown file format. (Markdown is a simple text editing syntax and the .md ending lets your computer know what type of file it is (similar to .pdf or .doc). You can read more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).)

Once you have named the file you can start adding content, but for now, lets just leave the new file blank and commit our changes. Committing changes is like saving your document. Github stores a copy of every committed file so that you can always go back to an old version. keep the default options selected (commit directly to the `master` branch) for now. Once you have commited the changes you should see them in your repository and the UI will show that your repo is a commit ahead of the original.

### 6. Making more Changes

Now that you have your folder and first file, you can add the rest of the content that you want. You can edit a document by navigating to it, clicking into it, and then clicking on the pencil icon at the top of the input box. 

If you are using the templates to create your application (which I recommend) you now have copies of those templates in your repository that you can copy from directly. These files are all written with markdown, which is a simple text editing syntax.
