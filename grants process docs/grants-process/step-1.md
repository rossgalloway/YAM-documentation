# Step 1: Propose Your Project (Temperature Check)

Welcome! The first step on your journey is to publicly announce the project that you would like to work on or create. This step lets you get a sense of how your project will be received by the Yam Community. There is no vote at this stage of the process, but if the initial reception is poor, you risk doing work you won't get paid for. There is a template application that you can use to post on the Forums. If you need help, pop into the discord and the Gov-Ops Council members can assist you with the application and help to ensure its completeness.

This is also the first step in the creation of a "Silo", which is a container that holds all the grants you apply for and receive.

Post your Application to the [Yam Forum](https://forum.yam.finance/) so the Yam community can review and discuss your proposal idea directly with you. Once you are satisfied with your application, Gov-Ops will issue a Silo that serves as a container for all aspects of your project going forward included in this step-by-step guide.

View the application form [here](/siloDocs/Template/silo-app-template.md) and clone/copy it from Github [here](https://github.com/rossgalloway/YAM-Project-Silos/blob/master/Template/silo-app-template.md)

## The Gov-Ops Council and Token holders Vet the Grant Application

Gov-Ops Council members can assist applicants with the Silo Application process. They are elected facilitators who make recommendations based on a set of pre-defined criteria. Their goal is to help clarify a projects value and scope and align interests between the Grant applicant and Yam token holders. Long-form posts and conversations about your project should happen on the Yam forum, with shorter, casual conversations on discord.

Based on input, you, as the applicant may modify the application at this point.

Gov-Ops issues the Silo as a container holding the documents produced in the remaining steps of the Yam Grants process.
