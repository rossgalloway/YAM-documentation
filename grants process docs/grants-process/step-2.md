# Step 2: Create a Specification Doc

Before you can submit a grant proposal to work on your project, you need to specify what you intend to build so that Yam Token holders can decide whether it is a project that they want to fund and understand the amount of work that will go into it. Because grants are contracts between YAM token holders and the contributor working on the project, understanding what the grant is paying for is crucial. The Project Specification document must be thorough and include as much information as possible for Token Holders to later determine whether the work promised matches the work done. The quality of these contracts determines the success of the Grants program.

You can create a Specifications Document either from the provided template or from your own format (We recommend the template if you don't have experience with documents like these, but feel free to tweak as needed). Gov-Ops can provide assistance as needed. If your project requires more extensive requirements and research, you can build a requirements definition phase into your Grant proposal (Step 3) and make it the first paid phase of your project.

When it is ready, Post your Specifications Document to the Yam Forum for review. Upon doing so, it is likely a discussion will take place between you, the Yam community and Yam token holders. This type of interaction and discussion with the Yam community is an important step for building support and consensus for Step 3 when you submit your Grant proposal.

See this Specification Template to get started

You can contact Gov-Ops on the Yam Discord if you have general questions about the Specifications documentation.

## Review

The Gov-Ops Council reviews documentation for completeness. Gov-Ops can also assist applicants in understanding what specifications are needed and how to best communicate them. Or help applicants target their requirements in a way that is most likely to answer Yam token holders questions so that they can make an informed vote.

Once the Requirements documentation is posted, Yam token holders can review and ask an additional round of questions and ask for more clarification.

The Applicant can decide to modify their Requirements document or decide to leave it as is.

Vote to approve the Project Specification and move to Grant Proposal phase. Yam token holders will vote YES if they see merit and value of the work or project based on your Specifications document, Silo Application and discussions.
